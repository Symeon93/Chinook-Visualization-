# Chinook-Visualization-

After attending the course 'Intermediate SQL' with Dataquest, I queried and analyzed the data with SQL within the Chinook Database. Upon executing the analysis, additional work 
took place to visualize the results with PowerBI in the form of a Dashboard. 

Lessons learned were the execution of complex queries and getting a solid understanding of how we can introduce data in PowerBI, use formulas within PowerBI to put the data in 
the desired format and finally draw an attractive visualization.
